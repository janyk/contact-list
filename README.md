At the latest revision of the app:

Shows a list of contacts retrieved from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
Navigates to a users business card when clicked on
Has search functionality on this list
Has a page that shows how many contacts there are that start with each letter of the alphabet


## Running Contact List Web App

To run the app run the following commands in terminal:

* `npm i`
* `npm start`

## TODO:

1. Complete testing container and 'component' components
2. Use sinon to test fetch call in appropriate container components
3. Elevate navigation component so as not to import in multiple top level components
4. Handle alternate entry points into app pages
5. Use cookies to store local data?
6. Handle errors thrown by fetch call, server not reached etc..
7. Make better looking and better resizable contact card
8. Generate random styling and components for contact cards
9. Use Scss
10. LINT
